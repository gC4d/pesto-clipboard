# Clipboard Synchronization Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a robust clipboard synchronization system for the Pesto Clipboard Flutter desktop application. The system automatically detects clipboard changes, sends them to the backend API, and keeps the frontend UI synchronized with real-time updates.

## Architecture

The implementation follows a layered architecture with the following components:

1. **Clipboard Monitor Service** - Detects system clipboard changes
2. **Clipboard Item Service** - Handles communication with the backend API
3. **Real-time Sync Service** - Manages synchronization with the backend
4. **Clipboard ViewModel** - Manages application state and business logic
5. **App Manager** - Initializes and manages the services

## Implementation Details

### 1. Clipboard Monitor Service

The `ClipboardMonitorService` actively monitors the system clipboard for changes using a periodic timer. It prevents duplicate submissions by tracking the last known clipboard content.

Key features:
- Polls the clipboard every 500ms
- Deduplicates content to prevent sending the same content multiple times
- Handles errors gracefully without stopping monitoring
- Uses the `clipboard` Flutter package to access system clipboard

### 2. Clipboard Item Service

The `ClipboardItemService` acts as a business logic layer wrapper around the `ApiService`. It provides a clean interface for clipboard operations and handles error cases.

### 3. Real-time Sync Service

The `RealtimeSyncService` keeps the frontend synchronized with the backend using a polling mechanism. It periodically fetches clipboard items from the backend and notifies listeners of changes.

Key features:
- Polls the backend every 5 seconds
- Compares item lists to detect changes
- Notifies listeners when items are updated or added
- Handles network errors gracefully

### 4. Integration with ViewModel

The `ClipboardViewModel` has been updated to use the `ClipboardItemService` instead of directly using the `ApiService`. This provides better separation of concerns and allows for easier testing.

### 5. App Manager Integration

The `AppManager` has been updated to initialize and start both the clipboard monitoring and real-time synchronization services during application startup.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

### Clipboard Monitoring Approach

**Chosen Approach**: Periodic polling with deduplication

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Native platform-specific clipboard listeners
- Third-party clipboard monitoring packages

**Reasoning**: 
- Flutter does not provide built-in clipboard change notifications
- Platform-specific solutions would require separate implementations for each platform
- Polling with a reasonable interval (500ms) provides a good balance between responsiveness and resource usage
- Deduplication prevents unnecessary API calls

### Real-time Updates Approach

**Chosen Approach**: Polling-based synchronization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- WebSocket connections
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Push notifications

**Reasoning**:
- Polling is simpler to implement and debug
- Reduces server complexity
- Works well with the existing REST API
- 5-second polling interval provides a good balance between real-time feel and server load
- Can be upgraded to WebSockets in the future if needed

## Resource Management

To prevent excessive CPU consumption:

1. Clipboard monitoring uses a 500ms polling interval
2. Real-time sync uses a 5-second polling interval
3. Services are properly disposed of when the app is closed
4. Error handling prevents infinite retry loops

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

1. Network failures are caught and logged without stopping services
2. API errors are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
3. Services continue running even when individual operations fail
4. Resource cleanup is performed during app disposal

## Testing Instructions

To test the clipboard synchronization:

1. Start the application
2. Copy text to the system clipboard
3. Verify that the content appears in the clipboard list
4. Copy the same text again
5. Verify that no duplicate entry is created
6. Create a new clipboard item from another client
7. Wait up to 5 seconds
8. Verify that the new item appears in the list

## Dependencies

The implementation uses the following packages:

- `clipboard` - For accessing system clipboard
- `dio` - For HTTP client functionality
- `provider` - For state management
- `get_it` - For dependency injection

## Future Improvements

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with WebSocket connections for true real-time updates
2. **Image Support**: Extend clipboard monitoring to handle images
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement more efficient diff algorithms for large clipboard histories
4. **Configuration**: Allow users to configure polling intervals
5. **Offline Support**: Add offline caching and synchronization
